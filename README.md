# Bronco Space Lab: Molecular Interface Structure

An interactive visualization tool that models organizational architecture using molecular metaphors. This application allows users to create custom teams, faculty, and interfaces with realistic energy loss modeling and visualization.

## üöÄ Features

### Custom Setup System
- **Team Creation**: Define custom teams with names, sizes, and descriptions
- **Faculty/Staff Management**: Add faculty members with roles and responsibilities
- **Interface Design**: Create custom interfaces between teams with different bond types
- **Energy Loss Modeling**: Realistic energy loss percentages based on interface strength

### Core Visualization
- **Molecular Representation**: Each team is represented as a molecule with distinct color coding
- **Bond Strength Visualization**: Different bond types show coupling strength between modules
- **Energy Flow Simulation**: Animated particles show knowledge transfer through the system
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live metrics showing system health and decomposition risk

### Interface Types with Energy Loss
- **Strong Institutional Bond (5% Energy Loss)**: Permanent institutional support, shared resources, formal collaboration agreements
- **Moderate Contract Bond (15% Energy Loss)**: Grant-funded collaboration, temporary contracts, project-based partnerships
- **Weak Informal Bond (35% Energy Loss)**: Informal communication, ad-hoc collaboration, personal relationships
- **Fragile Temporary Bond (60% Energy Loss)**: One-time interactions, minimal institutional support, high turnover risk

## üéØ How to Use

### Step 1: Setup Your Organization
1. **Define Teams**: Add your project teams with names, sizes, and descriptions
2. **Add Faculty/Staff**: Include faculty members, PIs, or staff with their roles
3. **Create Interfaces**: Connect teams with different types of bonds
4. **Generate Visualization**: Click to create your molecular structure

### Step 2: Analyze Your System
- **View Bond Strength**: Analyze the distribution of interface types
- **Simulate Energy Flow**: Watch knowledge transfer with realistic energy loss
- **Assess Decomposition Risk**: Identify areas where knowledge might be lost
- **Monitor Statistics**: Track system health metrics in real-time

### Understanding the Visualization

#### Molecule Types
- **Blue Molecules**: Your custom teams
- **Orange Molecules**: Faculty/Staff coordination hubs

#### Bond Types & Energy Loss
- **Green Bonds (Strong)**: 5% energy loss - Institutionally supported
- **Orange Bonds (Moderate)**: 15% energy loss - Contract/grant funded
- **Red Bonds (Weak)**: 35% energy loss - Informal collaboration
- **Flickering Red Bonds (Fragile)**: 60% energy loss - Temporary interactions

#### Energy Indicators
- **Cyan Particles**: Knowledge energy flowing through bonds
- **Red Particles**: Energy leaks proportional to bond weakness
- **More Red Particles**: Higher energy loss at weaker bonds

## üî¨ Technical Architecture

### Conceptual Framework
This application implements Herbert Simon's "Nearly Decomposable Systems" theory with realistic energy loss modeling:

1. **Micro-modules**: Custom teams with internal cohesion
2. **Interfaces**: User-defined bonds with varying strength and energy loss
3. **Knowledge Flow**: Energy particles with realistic dissipation
4. **Decomposition Risk**: Identified through weak bonds and energy leaks

### Key Metrics
- **Total Molecules**: Number of teams + faculty
- **Active Bonds**: Number of interface connections
- **Energy Flow Efficiency**: Percentage of strong bonds
- **Decomposition Risk**: Percentage of weak/fragile bonds
- **Total Energy Loss**: Average energy loss across all interfaces

### Energy Loss Modeling
The application uses realistic energy loss percentages based on organizational research:
- Strong institutional bonds lose minimal energy (5%)
- Contract-based bonds have moderate loss (15%)
- Informal bonds experience significant loss (35%)
- Temporary bonds lose most energy (60%)
